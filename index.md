## Welcome :)

Below you will find links to my different projects with their explanation and code. Be sure to check them all and leave any feedbacks through which i can update them.

### [Santander Customer Prediction](https://deepakit.github.io/Santander-Customer-Prediction)
In this challenge, we tried to help us identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. 
In Santander Customer Transaction Prediction ,we have a binary classification task.

### [Fuel Consumption(MPG) Prediction](https://deepakit.github.io/Fuel_Consumption_MPG_Prediction)

Data contains MPG variable which is continuous data and tells us about the efficiency of fuel consumption of a vehicle.
Our aim here is to predict the MPG value for a vehicle given we have other attributes.Here we're be going from data collection to deploying the Machine Learning model.

### [Credit Card Clustering](https://deepakit.github.io/Credit_card_clustering)

This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The
sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

### [Bank Loan Prediction Program](https://deepakit.github.io/Bank-Loan/)

The loan default dataset has 8 variables and 850 records, each record being loan default status for each customer. Each applicant was rated as “Defaulted(1)” or “Non-defaulted(0)”. New applicants for loan application can also be evaluated on these 8 predictor variables and classified as a default or non-default based on predictor variables.

### [Pokemon Data Analysis](https://deepakit.github.io/Pokemon_Data_Analysis)

We are trying to get a idea from the data given to us about pokemon present across seven generations.
We are trying to get information about which pokemon is strongest and weakest.


### [Tweet Classification]( https://deepakit.github.io/Disaster-Tweet-Classification)

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. In this notebook, challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. Dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified is provided.
